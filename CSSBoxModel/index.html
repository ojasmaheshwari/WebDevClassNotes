      Margin collapse:- Sometimes, the margin between two containers in a top to bottom or bottom to top flow
      combines/collapses into a single margin equal to the largest of the two. This is called Margin collapse. Note that
      this only happens in top to bottom or bottom to top flow and not in horizontal flow.

      When you pass 3 values in your margin shorthand, the first value sets your top, the middle sets in both left and
      right, the third sets your bottom.

      When you pass 2 values in your margin shorthand, the first value sets both top and bottom whereas the second value

      <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code> : Using this property, we can include the dimensions of padding and border of
      our container in its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. This solves the problem of padding increasing the
      size of our container.
